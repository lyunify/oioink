    <p><b>Privacy Policy</b></p>
    <p>Effective Date: January 1, 2023.</p>
    <p>oioink.com ('OiOink', 'we', or 'us') knows that our most important asset is our
        relationship with you. OiOink is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity,
        and security of any personal information about our users.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what type of information will be
        collected by OiOink when you use OiOink Service, how the information will be used,
        and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of
        information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as
        described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information
        we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.
        Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning
        given them in our Terms of Use.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>1. Information We Collect</b></p>
    <p>User-Provided Information: You provide us information about yourself, such as your name,
        address, e-mail address, and listing information, if you register for a Member account
        with the Service. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content
        of your email messages, your email address and our responses. We may also
        retain any messages you send through the Service. You may provide us
        information in User Content you post to the Service. You may provide us with
        credit card or other financial information in order to use the Service.</p>
    <p>Cookies Information: When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a
        small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your
        computer that uniquely identifies your browser and allows OiOink help you log in
        faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey
        anonymous information about how you browse the Service to us. A cookie does not
        collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your
        hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your
        browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by
        following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and
        disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse
        all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features
        of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is
        disabled.</p>
    <p>Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your
        browser each time you access a web page. When you use the Service, our servers
        automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever
        you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your
        web request, Internet Protocol ('IP') address, browser type, referring/exit
        myhome and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing myhome, myhome viewed,
        and other such information.</p>
    <p>Clear Gifs Information: When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also
        known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our
        users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your OiOink account
        is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in
        HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by
        recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve
        the effectiveness of our marketing, and make OiOink better for our users.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>2. How We Use Your Information</b></p>
    <p>We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to
        you the features and functionality of the Service.</p>
    <p>By providing OiOink your email address, you consent to our using the email address to
        send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in
        lieu of communication by postal mail. You also agree that we may send you
        notifications of activity on the Service to the email address you give us, in
        accordance with any applicable privacy settings. We may use your email address
        to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the
        Service, or special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages,
        you may opt out or change your preferences in your account page. Opting out may
        prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or
        offers. You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails. We may also use your
        address to send you mail, including for the promotion program.</p>
    <p>Following termination or deactivation of your Member account, OiOink may retain your profile
        information and User Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup,
        archival, or audit purposes. Furthermore, OiOink may retain and continue to use
        indefinitely all information contained in your communications to other Users or
        posted to public or semi-public areas of the Service after termination or
        deactivation of your Member account.</p>
    <p>If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the Service, we
        will ask you for that person's email address and automatically send an email
        invitation. OiOink stores this information to send this email, to register your
        friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our
        invitation service. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this
        information from our database by emailing us at
        <a href='mailto:privacy@oioink.com' title='Send Mail to Privacy Dept'>privacy@oioink.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>OiOink may use certain information about you and/or your User Content internally for
        purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or
        technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content.</p>
    <p>OiOink reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post
        on the Service. We reserve the right to remove any such information or material
        for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if in our sole
        opinion such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable
        law or our Terms of Use Agreement, or to protect or defend our rights or
        property or those of any third party. OiOink also reserves the right to remove information
        upon the request of any third party.</p>
    <p>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (i) remember information
        so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you
        visit the site; (ii) provide custom, personalized content and information; (iii)
        monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (iv) monitor aggregate metrics such as
        total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (v) diagnose or
        fix technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are associated
        with certain IP addresses; (vi) help you efficiently access your information
        after you sign in; and (vii) track User Content and Users to the extent necessary
        to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>3. How We Share Your Information</b></p>
    <p>Personally Identifiable Information: OiOink will not rent or sell your
        personally identifiable information to others.
        OiOink may share your personally identifiable information
        with third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you. If we do
        this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy
        Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct
        control of OiOink (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting
        providers).</p>
    <p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings.
        Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred
        business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign
        such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or
        dissolution.</p>
    <p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to
        the Service, such as User Content or listing information, becomes available to the
        public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. To change your
        privacy settings on the Service, go to your account page. If you remove
        information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in
        cached and archived myhome of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved
        that information.</p>
    <p>From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or
        activities ('Events') on the Service together with a third party partner. If
        you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use
        it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot
        control third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your
        information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not
        to participate in these Events.</p>
    <p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, OiOink will not disclose personal
        information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or
        if we believe that such action is necessary to (i) conform to the law, comply
        with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or
        take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (ii) to enforce
        our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend
        ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government
        enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and
        (iii) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of OiOink, our
        Users or others.</p>
    <p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share non-personally identifiable information
        (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit myhome and URLs, platform types,
        number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand
        the usage patterns for certain OiOink services.</p>
    <p>OiOink may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the
        Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send,
        directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on OiOink. They
        automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use
        other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the
        effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising
        content. OiOink does not provide any personally identifiable information to these
        third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please
        note that if an advertiser asks OiOink to show an advertisement to a certain
        audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may
        conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
        The OiOink Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities
        of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of
        such advertisers for more information.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>4. How We Protect Your Information</b></p>
    <p>OiOink uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to
        preserve the integrity and security of your personal information and implement
        your privacy settings. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of
        any information you transmit to OiOink or guarantee that your information on the
        Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any
        of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
    <p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting
        a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your
        account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique
        password and account information, and for controlling access to your email
        communications from OiOink, at all times.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>5. Compromise of Personal Information</b></p>
    <p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of
        security, OiOink will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has
        been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in
        this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>6. Your Choices About Your Information</b></p>
    <p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through
        the Service, in which case OiOink may not be able to provide certain services to
        you. You may update or correct your account information and email preferences
        at any time by logging in to your account navigating to the account page. You
        can review and correct the information about you that OiOink keeps on file by
        contacting us directly at <a href='mailto:privacy@oioink.com'
            title='Send Mail to Privacy Dept'>privacy@oioink.com</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>7. Children's Privacy</b></p>
    <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to us. OiOink is designed 
        for children aged 6-12, but all account registration and personal information collection 
        is done by parents, guardians, or legal representatives who are 18 years of age or older. 
        We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under 13. All 
        registration, account creation, and data submission must be completed by an adult.</p>
    <p>When a parent or guardian creates an account, they may provide limited information about their 
        child (such as a child's name or nickname for the virtual wallet) to personalize the 
        educational experience. This information is collected with parental consent and is used solely 
        for the purpose of providing the financial education service. Parents have full control over 
        their child's account and can review, modify, or delete any information at any time.</p>
    <p>We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable 
        laws. If you believe that we have collected information from a child under 13 without proper 
        parental consent, please contact us immediately at
        <a href='mailto:privacy@oioink.com' title='Send Mail to Privacy Dept'>privacy@oioink.com</a>, 
        and we will promptly delete such information.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>8. Links to Other Web Sites</b></p>
    <p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from
        the Service, nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember
        that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy
        Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other
        website, including those that have a link on our website, is subject to that
        website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies
        before proceeding.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>9. Notification Procedures</b></p>
    <p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required
        by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via
        email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of
        such notice on the Service, as determined by OiOink in its sole discretion. We
        reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to
        you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as
        described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>10. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</b></p>
    <p>If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on
        the Service to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and
        under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are
        effective when they are posted on this page.</p>

        or your dealings with this website, please contact us at
