        applications for third-party web sites and services, and any other mobile or

    <p>A.
        Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California;
        and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a

        of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on
        Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any claim
        or dispute between you and OiOink that arises in whole or in part from the Service
        shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in
        Santa Clara County, California, unless submitted to arbitration

        Arbitration. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable
        relief) under this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less
        than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute
        through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The party electing such arbitration
