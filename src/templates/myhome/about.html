                    <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
                    <p class="section-text hero-text">
                        OiOink (pronounced as "oink oink"—the first "nk" is not pronounced when saying OiOink) is the sound of a 
                        piggy, and it represents something special: a piggy bank where children can safely learn about money. 
                        Most children don't get to practice with real money until they're much older. But why should that stop them 
                        from learning how to manage it? That's the challenge we wanted to solve. We asked ourselves: 
                        <strong>What if every child could learn financial skills in a safe space, regardless of their family's 
                        circumstances?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-text hero-text">
                        But there was another question that mattered just as much: <strong>What if we could build a tool that 
                        doesn't just teach—but actually gives kids the power to make their own choices and learn from them?</strong> 
                        Too many educational apps tell children what to do. We wanted to create something that helps them discover 
                        what they're capable of.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-text hero-text">
                        So we combined our background in technology and research to build OiOink—a place where children don't just 
                        memorize financial facts, but develop <em>real confidence</em> in their ability to make smart decisions. 
                        Here, they're in control of their learning, and that makes all the difference.
                    </p>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Our Vision</h2>
                <p class="section-text">
                    OiOink was born from a simple yet powerful belief: every child deserves the opportunity to learn about money, 
                    regardless of their circumstances. Many children don't have access to real money to practice with, but that 
                    shouldn't prevent them from building essential financial skills.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    We've created a safe, virtual environment where children can explore financial concepts, practice making 
                    decisions, and build confidence—all without real-world financial risks. Through interactive lessons, virtual 
                    wallets, saving goals, and achievement systems, kids learn by doing, not just by reading.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Empowerment Through Design</h2>
                <p class="section-text">
                    We built OiOink because we got tired of seeing educational apps that tell kids exactly what to do. Instead, 
                    we wanted to create something that gives children real choices and lets them learn from their decisions. 
                    Every feature in OiOink puts kids in the driver's seat—they choose their goals, make their own spending 
                    decisions, and see the results of their choices.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    That's why OiOink teaches more than just how money works. It teaches kids to trust their judgment, think 
                    through problems, and feel confident making decisions. When children set their own saving goals, track their 
                    progress, and celebrate their achievements, they're building something bigger than financial knowledge—they're 
                    building confidence in themselves.
                </p>
